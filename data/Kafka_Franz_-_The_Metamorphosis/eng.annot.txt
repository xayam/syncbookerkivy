Metamorphosis is the story of Gregor Samsa, a young traveling salesman who lives with his family and financially supports his parents and younger sister. One morning he awakes to discover that during the night he has been transformed into a horrible vermin. Although somewhat of a horror genre, the story is often very funny as Gregor, his family and those around him deal with their own transformations as a result of this odd predicament.
